    <p><strong>HyperSignal</strong> — Infrastructure-level design</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      HyperSignal is designed as infrastructure, not as an application.
      The technology focuses on resilience, simplicity and long-term scalability
      rather than short-term performance optimizations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Layered Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      The HyperSignal system follows a multi-layer architecture model,
      allowing each component to evolve independently while maintaining
      overall system integrity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Signal Layer</h2>
    <p>
      The Signal Layer handles encrypted, verifiable communication units.
      It is designed to operate without centralized routing or control,
      ensuring continuity even under partial network failure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Intelligence Layer</h2>
    <p>
      The Intelligence Layer introduces human-guided artificial intelligence
      to optimize signal routing, prioritization and system balance.
      AI assists the system without removing human oversight.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Expansion Layer</h2>
    <p>
      The Expansion Layer prepares the infrastructure for long-range,
      high-latency and future communication environments.
      This includes concepts designed to remain compatible
      with emerging technologies and research domains.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security & Reliability</h2>
    <p>
      Security is treated as a structural requirement rather than an add-on.
      The system avoids single points of failure and prioritizes
      predictable behavior under stress conditions.
